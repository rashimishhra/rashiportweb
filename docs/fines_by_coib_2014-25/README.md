# NYC COIB Fines
I tried to analyse and visualise the reasons/caused for which the NYC Conflict of Interest Board fined public servants/former public servants from various city government departments in 11 years (2014-2025) under Bill De Blasio and Eric Adams' administrations. I tried to find the total sum for each reasin listed and the number of times the reason was used to fine them. 

I also tried to find the city department which paid the most fines and the most number of times over the duration that I chose. 

Although a good insight from a source would have added depth to the story, I was unable to get anyone aboard from the NYC council on the mater in the given time. 

Short description of your findings

Department of Education and Health and Hospitals Department were fined the most amount of sum, equivalent to US $ 200k, though it was the education department which was fined the most number of times. 

Also, "Use of City Position" was the reason for which the departments paid the highest sum in 11 years. 

I found the data on NYC Open Data provided by COIB. https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Enforcement-Fines/p39r-nm7f/data

I used the Google Sheets to filter and assort the data. 

I wanted to try visualising the data better using line graph, however, that was not possible with the Visualising tools that I know. The major issue was the number range for number of times fines paid and the amount of fines paid.
